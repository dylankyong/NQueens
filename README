HW1: NQueens

Collaboration: I discussed this lab with Shimon Islam and Allen Yabut.
We spoke about various ways to solve this lab, but we did not share code.

I used the String Tokenizer from Lab2 to split up the input file.

Files:
NQueens.java (Primary class with most of the important code)
Queen.java (Object class with queen properties and functions)
test-input.txt (Test text input file)
test-output.txt (Test text output file)
out.txt (Test for code output)
Makefile (jar creator)
README (Notes and sources for HW1)
